#### Building Libraries 

<dl>
<dt> Project Locations</dt>
<dd> Production/Utilities/UniversalUtilities</dd>
<dd> Production/Utilities/AndroidUtilities</dd>
<dd> Production/Utilities/JavaUtilities </dd>
<dd Production/ThaliDeviceHub/Universal</dd>
</dl>

The previous all produce libraries. So they are built as given below.

To actually do a build:

1. Follow the instructions in [UnderstandingThalisUseOfMaven](UnderstandingThalisUseOfMaven)

1. Open the Git bash shell, go to the root of each project (in the order listed above, order matters since they have dependencies on each other) and issue 'gradlew uploadArchives'

#### Building Thali Device Hubs 

<dl>
<dt> Project Locations</dt>
<dd> Production/ThaliDeviceHub/android</dd>
<dd> Production/ThaliDeviceHub/java</dd>
</dl>

These both produce executables. 

Android produces an apk which you can find in Production/ThaliDeviceHub/android/android/build/apk after doing a "gradlew build". You can use adb to install the apk.

Java, after a "gradlew distZip" produces Production/ThaliDeviceHub/java/build/distributions/java.zip. Move that zip some place nice, unzip it and then executed from your friendly neighborhood command line 'java.jar'.

##### Build executables 

<dl>
<dt> Project Locations</dt>
<dd> Production/ThaliDeviceHub/android</dd>
</dl>

Right now there is just one project here that builds the Thali Device Hub for Android. Soon we will hopefully add a second project to build a Java JAR that will run the Thali Device Hub for use on desktop OSs.

In the case of android the output is an apk file that can then be run as an android program. To build the apk just go into the android project and run 'gradlew build'
