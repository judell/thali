#### Project Description 

**What**: An experiment to see what it would take to make the web truly Peer to Peer

**How**: Use existing standards and provide a reference implementation. The platform currently consists of identity (public keys), authentication (mutual SSL auth), traffic analysis protection and connectivity (Tor Hidden Services) and data portability/synchronization (CouchDB). The reference implementation is in Java and runs on Android, Linux, Mac and Windows. We are also providing tools to make it easy to write HTML5 applications that can run on the Thali platform.

**Why**: To enable users to run their services with their data on whatever devices/clouds they want.

**Who**: Thali is being actively developed by Ivan Judson, Jason Poon, Jim Spring, Jon Udell, Stefan Gordon and Yaron Y. Goland assigned to the Microsoft Open Technologies Hub. We're a pretty hearty team but we certainly could use a lot of help! Please see [[Ways to Contribute]] if you would like to help! Because boy do we need it!

#### Technology Investigations 

Thali has looked at a number of possible ways to implement itself. Below we provide links to those investigations.

* [[WebRTC Investigation]]
* [[Stun/Turn/ICE_Investigation]]
* [[HTML 5 Raw Sockets Investigation]]
* [[Building Thali on top of Firefox]]
* [[Building Thali on top of I2P]]

Thali has also looked at how it can leverage existing technologies. Those investigations are below.

* [[Thalis Requirements for CouchBase]]
* [[Crosswalk and Cordova]]
* [[Building the HTML5 Environment Thali Needs]]
* [[Thali and Tor Onion Proxy]]
* [[Thali and Tor Hidden Services]]
* [[CouchDB Clients to Thali enable]]
